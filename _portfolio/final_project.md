## Project Name: 
Assessing Land Cover Change Analysis in Ganga Brahmaputra River Basin

## Introduction: 
This project aims to explore the land cover change matrix analysis in the Ganga-Brahmaputra River Basin for the year 1995 and 2015, also the percentage of change through R-Studio. It will discuss its applications in assessing the impacts of land cover change, understanding the underlying drivers, and guiding effective land management strategies

## Abstract: 
The land cover change matrix is an effective instrument utilized in land cover analysis to evaluate and measure the shifts between distinct land cover categories over a specific period. It offers a methodical and organized framework for comprehending the patterns of land cover change and the fundamental factors influencing these transformations.

## Data sources:
The Data has been collected from the following sources:
- Major River Basins: World Bank Data Catalog
- Global Land Cover Data: European Space Agency
## Results:
 The Land Cover Change Matrix has been performed to analyze the percentage land cover change matrix of Ganga Brahmaputra River Basin for the year 1995 and 2015.

- According to the percentage analysis there was a significant amount of land cover change in the Ganges Brahmaputra River Basin between 1995 and 2015. The most dramatic changes were in the areas of artificial surface, herbaceous crop, and woody area. These areas all experienced significant increases in land cover, with the percentage change ranging from 241% to 44,555%

## Environment: 
QGIS
