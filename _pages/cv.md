 * USE OF SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING & GIS FOR EXTRACTION OF DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS USING OPEN SOURCE DATA PRODUCTS & SOFTWARE : CASE STUDIES (Technix International Journal of Engineering TIJER), August 25, 2022:  Digital Elevation models have grown to become an integral part of a number of scientific applications. DEMs can be created from the ground surveys, digitizing existing hardcopy topographic maps or by remote sensing techniques. DEMâ€™s are now predominantly created using remote sensing techniques with observing the benefits that a large spatial area can be mapped by fewer
people at a lower cost. For the present paper, the Digital Elevation model analysis has been done for the area of Chimmini Dam in Echippara in Chalakudy taluk of Thrissur District of Kerala and Idamalayar Dam in Ennakkal near Bhoothathankettu in Ernakulum district of Kerala has been selected for Watershed and Network Delineation. Publication : Volume 9 Issue 8

* LAND USE PATTERN USING SEMI- AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION PLUGIN (SCP) WITH OPEN SOURCE DATA (International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology), 2022  April 17, 2022 : Since the early 1970s, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the UnitedStates) has been developing a series of multispectral satellites known as Landsat. Landsat photos are frequently used in environmental studies. Image classification is one of the most important tasks in image processing and analysis. It's used to look at different forms of land use and cover. Satellite photos, like high resolution satellite images, are obtained using remote sensing. However, just examining these photos isn't enough; we also need toprocess them. Thus, to analyze these images, we need to classify them. For this paper the Landsat classification has been performed on the Sungai Petani a major city in Malaysia. Using Landsat 8-OLI data, this paper propose a wavelet transform-based Landsat classification. This classification analysis has been performed using the plugin tool Semi-Automatic Classification tool in QGIS software. Publication : Volume 6 Issue 12
